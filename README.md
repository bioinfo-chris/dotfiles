# dotfiles
Because its annoying having an inconsistent environment.

The goals of these dotfiles are:

* Human-useful environment (for my preferences...)
* Support for both OS X and Linux
* Not excessive
* Conda with default envs for py27 and py35 which include numpy, scipy, pandas
    jupyter and matplotlib

# installation

Just do the things:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wasade/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles/bin
./bootstrap.sh
```

`bootstrap.sh` will backup any replaced dotfiles.
